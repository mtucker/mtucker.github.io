    <h1>Container Gardens</h1>

    <section>

        <p>
        The rear of my apartment in Ridgewood, Queens overlooks a rooftop that is accessible by crawling out my kitchen window and over the fire escape. I've always wanted to grow some vegetables out there. Since it seems like we will be under some level of lockdown in NYC most of the summer due to coronavirus, it seems like a good time to give it a try.

            Apparently, this type of garden is called a "container garden" - growing vegetables and things in planters, buckets, etc. I have no idea what I'm doing so I need to do some research which I will document here.

        <p>
            First of all, what to grow? This is what I'm thinking to start with:
        </p>

        <ul aria-label="Veggies">
            <li><a href="#cherry-tomatoes">Cherry Tomatoes</a></li>
            <li>Some kind of lettuce</li>
            <li>Cucumbers</li>
        </ul>

        <ul aria-label="Herbs">
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to plant</h3>

        <p>
            I think I'm going to try to grow these from seedlings rather than seed, seems easier and faster. Some thoughts on when to plant them:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Cherry tomatoes need warm weather to grow and they will die when exposed to frost. The last frost date should pass a week before you begin planting. The weather should be around 70 in Fahrenheit and around 21 in Celsius when planting seedlings.

        <p>
            According to the <a href="https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates/NY/New%20York">Old Farmer's Almanac</a>, the last frost date for New York City in 2020 was April 5. I'm writing this on May 24 so we are well past that date. Hopefully it's not too late to plant?
