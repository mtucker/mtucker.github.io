# Looking at cars John's advice

* Ask mechanic to "make sure all the monitors are passed".
* Check for leaks
* Make sure A/C blows cold
* While you have it up - show me what you're seeing
* Make sure it hasn't been in an accident
* Tires and breaks wear out, no reason not to buy it
* What can I look for:
  * Look at tires, brand of tires - brand you know
  * May have original tires & battery
  * Pay attention to comfort of the car - Corollas are small
  * Go in the trunk, lift up floor mat and look in the spare tire well
  * Spare tire there
  * 2009 Toyota - don't buy
  * 2012 Toyota Camry - good car (torque converter might shudder getting up around 30mph)
* Go at your own pace
* If someone's a dick
* Go up the chain if you need to
* Text John the ad for the car with the VIN
* Unless insane anomaly Corolla's are good
